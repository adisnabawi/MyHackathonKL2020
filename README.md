# My Hackathon KL 2020
## A solution for the PRIHATIN THEMES No. 4 


Our solution is based on the QR Code where the information is encrypted and users just need to scan the QR code. It will populate the input form automatically.
Thus it solve the disrepancies and the need for the users to entered manually.

The dencrypted data as follow:
```
{
   "nama":"adis nabawi",
   "ic":910112111234,
   "alamat":"Kampung Siput, Dimana mana, 06000 Jitra, Kedah",
   "status":"warganegara",
   "agama":"islam",
   "jantina":"lelaki"
}
```
